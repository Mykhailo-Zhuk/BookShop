Soon his former nemesis Masha emerges from the political underground to gift him with a thumbdrive containing a Wikileaks-style cable-dump of hard evidence of corporate and governmental perfidy. It's incendiary stuff\u2014and if Masha goes missing, Marcus is supposed to release it to the world. Then Marcus sees Masha being kidnapped by the same government agents who detained and tortured Marcus years earlier.\r\n\r\nMarcus can leak the archive Masha gave him\u2014but he can't admit to being the leaker, because that will cost his employer the election. He's surrounded by friends who remember what he did a few years ago and regard him as a hacker hero. He can't even attend a demonstration without being dragged onstage and handed a mike. He's not at all sure that just dumping the archive onto the Internet, before he's gone through its millions of words, is the right thing to do.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, people are beginning to shadow him, people who look like they're used to inflicting pain until they get the answers they want.\r\n\r\nFast-moving, passionate, and as current as next week, Homeland is every bit the equal of Little Brother\u2014a paean to activism, to courage, to the drive to make the world a better place."}, "links": [{"url": "http://craphound.com/homeland/", "type": {"key": "/type/link"}, "title": "Official website"}, {"url": "http://craphound.com/homeland/download/", "type": {"key": "/type/link"}, "title": "Download Creative Commons version"}], "title": "Homeland", "covers": [10847850, 7407631, 8444739, 10461147, 12618847, 11521916], "subject_places": ["Black Rock City"], "subjects": ["United States", "Practical Politics", "United States.

How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism was first published online in August, where it was an instant hit with readers, scholars, and critics alike. For years now, we've been hearing about the ills of surveillance capitalism - the business of extracting, collecting, and selling vast reams of user data that has exploded with the rise of tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. But what if everything we've been hearing is wrong? What if surveillance capitalism is not some rogue capitalism or a wrong turn taken by some misguided corporations? What if the system is working exactly as intended - and the only hope of restoring an open web is to take the fight directly to the system itself? In Doctorow's timely and crucial new nonfiction work, the internationally bestselling author of Walkaway, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, and Little Brother, argues that if we're to have any hope of destroying surveillance capitalism, we're going to have to destroy the monopolies that currently comprise the commercial web as we know it. Only by breaking apart the tech giants that totally control our online experiences can we hope to return to a more open and free web - one where predatory data-harvesting is not a founding principle. Doctorow shows how, despite popular misconception, Facebook and Google do not possess any \"mind-control rays\" capable of brainwashing users into, say, voting for a presidential candidate or joining an extremist group--they have simply used their monopoly power to profit mightily off of people interested in doing those things and made it easy for them to find each other.Doctorow takes us on a whirlwind tour of the last 30 years of digital rights battles and the history of American monopoly - and where the two intersect. Through a deeply compelling and highly readable narrative, he makes the case for breaking up Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple as a means of ending surveillance capitalism."}, "covers": [10827755], "subjects": ["Technology", "Business", "Internet", "Economics"], "latest_revision": 5, "revision": 5, "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2021-03-23T01:55:00.689973"}, "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2023-07-21T14:03:36.105738"}}, {"title": "Force Multiplier", "authors": [{"author": {"key": "/authors/OL1394244A"}, "type": {"key": "/type/author_role"}}], "key": "/works/OL24038061W", "type": {"key": "/type/work"}, "latest_revision": 1, "revision": 1, "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2020-12-16T14:39:25.704994"}, "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2020-12-16T14:39:25.704994"}}, {"title": "Attack Surface", "covers": [10129079, 12016375], "key": "/works/OL20825335W", "authors": [{"author": {"key": "/authors/OL1394244A"}, "type": {"key": "/type/author_role"}}], "type": {"key": "/type/work"}, "subject_places": ["San Francisco", "San Fransisco"], "subjects": ["Science Fiction", "Hackers", "Terrorism", "Politics", "surveillance", "technology", "privacy", "technothriller", "cybersecurity", "American literature"], "description": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "**Cory Doctorow's *Attack Surface* is a standalone novel set in the world of New York Times bestsellers *Little Brother* and *Homeland*.**\r\n\r\nMost days, Masha Maximow was sure she'd chosen the winning side.\r\n\r\nIn her day job as a counterterrorism wizard for an transnational cybersecurity firm, she made the hacks that allowed repressive regimes to spy on dissidents, and manipulate their every move.
